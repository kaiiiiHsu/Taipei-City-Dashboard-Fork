    Fixed Numerous FE Bugs [deploy debug 2] (#143)
    
    **IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request without creating an
    issue first.**
    
    This repository is still under internal development. All outside pull
    requests will be closed immediately.
    
    ## Summary
    
    Deployment debug session 2. Fixed the following bugs:
    - Block user from setting name to "".
    - Don't call modify user API if the name remains the same and remember
    to close the dialog.
    - Only fetch map layer components once in mapview to increase
    performance.
    - Make sure map layer components are also loaded before displaying all
    components in mapview to prevent flashing
    - Changed the order in which component data APIs are called. All chart
    data APIs will be called before history data APIs to reduce first
    contentful paint time.
    - Introduce support for map legend data download.
    - Add "more info" to map layer components
    - Fixed DistrictChart's null value handling bug
    - Fixed component tags bug in mobile version (only show history data
    tag)
